## Establishment Background and Purpose

- As the demand for overseas urban development, especially investment-oriented projects, continues to grow, we aim to establish an international urban and infrastructure development research center to support domestic related companies' entry into overseas markets.
- We aim to improve the quality of life in global cities by theoretically and empirically analyzing the problems that Korean and global cities are facing and proposing reasonable policy alternatives to solve them. In order to do this, the main purpose of this research center is to promote the development of domestic and foreign cities through research and technology transfer activities related to urban and infrastructure development.
- Not only will we actively promote various research, seminars, workshops, publication of research results, education of domestic and foreign civil servants and experts related to cities, but we also plan and implement university-industry collaborative research projects to share the research achievements of the research center both internally and externally, contributing to the construction of an international network for urban development.

## Organization

- Considering the uniqueness of its establishment, the research center was initially set up as a center under the 'Urban Science Research Institute' already established at the Seoul City University, and it aims to grow into an independent research institute based on future activity achievements.
- To provide overall guidance on the center's activities and manage operational matters, an operating guidance committee is set up, which includes the Dean and faculty of the Graduate School of International Urban Science (GSUS), as well as the Center Director.
- To take responsibility for and carry out the day-to-day activities of the center, a Center Director is appointed, who is recommended by the Dean of GSUS in accordance with the relevant regulations of the 'Urban Science Research Institute'.
- To achieve the center's purpose, a research planning department and an education department are established, and additional research departments or teams can be established as needed. In addition, research committee members, invited research members, responsible researchers, and researchers can be appointed for specific research activities.
